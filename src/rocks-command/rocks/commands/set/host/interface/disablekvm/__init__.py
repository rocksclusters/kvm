	appear on the host at the first restart.
	This functionality can be used in conjunction with the plugins of 
	rocks report host vm config 

	<arg type='string' name='host' optional='0'>
	One or more VM host names.

	<arg type='string' name='iface'>
 	Interface that should be updated. This may be a logical interface or 
 	the mac address of the interface.
 	</arg>

	<param type='bool' name='disablekvm'>
	If true it will disable kvm bridging

	<param type='string' name='iface'>
	Can be used in place of the iface argument.
