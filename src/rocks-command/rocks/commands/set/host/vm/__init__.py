# Rework of the disk management in kvm
#
# - Now it support qcow2 format (default is still raw
#
# - Now it is also possible to specify the device used to
#   expose the disk inside the virtual machine
#
# - added some docs on the new disk string format

# Preliminary testing on 64bit complete.

# Revision 1.7  2009/01/14 00:20:56  bruno
# unify the physical node and VM node boot action functionality
#
# - all bootaction's are global
#
# - the node table has a 'runaction' (what bootaction should the node do when
#   a node normally boots) and an 'installaction (the bootaction for installs).
#
# - the 'boot' table has an entry for each node and it dictates what the node
#   will do on the next boot -- it will look up the runaction in the nodes table
#   (for a normal boot) or the installaction in the nodes table (for an install).
#
# Revision 1.6  2009/01/12 23:53:30  bruno
# don't reset the install profile to 'install' if the 'installprofile' flag is
# not supplied
