	"""
	Destroy a VM slice on a physical node.

	<param type='bool' name='terminate'>
	If this is true the command will run only the plugin since it will
	assume that the host is already down.
	This is used by to invoke the plugin when the machine is powered 
	so external allocated resource can be freed (e.g. iSCSI connection)
	NB: if terminate is not equal to true the plugin will not be called.
	Basically the command either stops the VM or calls the plugins (this
	is to account for the fact that the libvirtd hooks are called both
	when the host is shutdown and when the host is forcefully stopped
	with rocks stop host vm)
	</param>

	<param type='string' name='action'>
	poweroff will shut down the VM immediately (default)
	shutdown will send the ACPI shutdown signal to the guest OS
	reset will poweroff and poweron the VM
	reboot will send the ACPI reboot signal to the guest OS
	</param>


	<arg type='string' name='host' repeat='1'>
	A list of one or more VM host names.
	</arg>

	<example cmd='stop host vm compute-0-0-0'>
	Stop VM host compute-0-0-0. This is equivalent to a 'hard power off',
	(i.e., pulling the power cord from a node).
	</example>
