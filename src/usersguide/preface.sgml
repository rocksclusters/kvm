<para>
The KVM Roll installs and configures Virtual Machines (VMs) on Rocks Clusters.
</para>

<para>
A physical frontend can configure VMs on client nodes 
(<emphasis>VM container</emphasis> appliances).
A VM container is a physical machine that houses and runs VMs.
</para>

<para>
The KVM Roll also supports building virtual clusters.
The frontend can be installed as a <emphasis>VM server</emphasis> appliance
and the client nodes can be installed as VM containers.
Then a virtual frontend can be installed on the VM server while virtual
compute nodes can be installed on the VM containers.
All network traffic is encapsulated within a unique VLAN, that is, each
virtual cluster has its own VLAN.
