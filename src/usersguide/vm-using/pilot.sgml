<para>
"Pilot" is a program that can be used on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux systems to
remotely and securely control VMs that are housed on Rocks Clusters.
Pilot communicates to the "Airboss" (see section <xref linkend="airboss">
for more info) on a Rocks frontend.
Pilot can power off, power on, install and connect to the
console of VMs.

<para>
First, you'll need to install "curl" on your machine.
Download and unzip the following file:

<para>
The above will download: Pilot, VCredist, Python v2.7, OpenSSL and M2Crypto.

<para>
Install VCredist, Python v2.7, OpenSSL and M2Crypto by executing:
</para>

<para>

<section id="pilot-key-pair"

	<title>Create a Public/Private Key Pair</title>

<para>
Pilot uses a private/public key pair to authenticate its messages with
the Airboss.
If you haven't already created a key pair and associated the public key with
the virtual frontend of the cluster you wish to remotely control, then login to
the physical frontend that houses your virtual cluster and execute the
procedure found here: <xref linkend="creating-keys">.
</para>

<para>
Then copy the private key to the same directory on your machine where you have
installed "pilot.py".

Pilot sends messages to the Airboss on port 8677.
We'll need to open a secure tunnel and forward port 8677 from your local
machine to the Rocks frontend where the Airboss is running.

	<title>Using Pilot for Remote VM Power Control</title>

<para>
Before you get started, open a new terminal session on your machine.
Pilot is a command-line utility.
</para>

<para>
To power on a VM, you must know the MAC address of the VM you wish to power on.
Assuming you want to power on the VM named "frontend-0-0-0" on your
physical frontend, execute:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
# rocks list host interface frontend-0-0-0
SUBNET  IFACE MAC               IP              NETMASK       MODULE NAME                  VLAN OPTIONS CHANNEL

</screen>
</para>

<para>
The VM frontend-0-0-0 has the MAC addresses of 76:77:6e:40:00:00 and
76:77:6e:40:00:01.
You can use either with pilot.
</para>

<para>
To power on frontend-0-0-0, execute:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
$ ./pilot.py set host power host=76:77:6e:40:00:00 key=private.key action=on
</screen>
</para>

<para>
To power off frontend-0-0-0, execute:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
$ ./pilot.py set host power host=76:77:6e:40:00:00 key=private.key action=off
</screen>
</para>

<para>
To power on and to force frontend-0-0-0 to install, execute:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
$ ./pilot.py set host power host=76:77:6e:40:00:00 key=private.key action=install
</screen>

	<title>Using Pilot to Connect to a VM's Console</title>

<para>
You can also connect to a VMs console with pilot by executing:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
$ ./pilot.py open host console host=76:77:6e:40:00:00 key=private.key
</screen>
</para>

<warning>
<para>
When you connect to a VM's console, you will see two mouse pointers, that is,
the mouse pointers are not in "sync".
You will have to experiment to find which pointer is the true pointer for the
console.
